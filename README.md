# Python-with-pygame

## This Project is a simple game that is being developed over PyGame Module uder the Python Environment

**The Main and the Entire Code is present in the Game Folder**

In this Game I have taken the Inspiration of Mario and made a Python Edition of the same.

### For Executing the program
Just simply open the mario.py using the Python IDLE and go to Run Option on the Top and click on the Run Module it should work

### Extra Works
I have also developed some other Python based Applications that can be used like Tracing co-ordinates of a ball and Binary search Depection using Python that can be [executed](#for-executing-the-program) in the same manner as mentioned above.

Hope you will like the Project!!
